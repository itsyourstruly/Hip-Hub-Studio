The Hip Hub.

The website is split into 2 sides; Side A & Side B.

Side A consists of general music news, discussion, and social connections.

Side B consists of the Studio which allows artists to fill in a verse for other artists, request verses, and Artists can step into a virtual booth to collaborate with others.
